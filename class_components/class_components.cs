// access modifiers in c#

// public
// private
// protected -> accessible for that class and derived classes
// internal -> accessible within the same assembly. (what does assembly mean?)
// protected internal -> accessible within the same assembly or from derived classes
// private protected -> accessible only within the containing class or derived classes in the same assembly

//  What is an Assembly in C#?
// An assembly is the compiled output of your C# project â€” usually a:

// .exe file (if it's an application)

// .dll file (if it's a library)

// You can think of an assembly as a bundle of compiled code that the .NET runtime can execute or reference.
